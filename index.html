              this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience.
              As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew
              she'd gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for. It
              wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a
              pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal."

            his hip over the weatherman. It was going to rain, so he better get
            outside and prepare.
